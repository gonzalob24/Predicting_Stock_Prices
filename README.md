# STOCK MARKET ANALYSIS
------

###### I will be analyzing the stock market in general and selecte a few stocks to analyze individually.

###### I will be using Pandas to get stock information and visualizeing it with seaborn. I will also look at different ways of anlyzing the risk of a stock, based on previous peformance. I will also be predicting future stock prices by using Monte Carlo Simulations. 


###### Along the way I will be ansering a few questions along the way. For Example:
	1. WHAT WAS THE CHANGE IN PRICE OF THE STOCK OVER TIME?
	2. WHAT WAS THE DAILY RETURN OF THE STOCK ON AVERAGE?
	3. WHAT WAS THE MOVING AVERAGE OF THE VAROIS STOCK?
	4. WHAT WAS THE CORRELATION BETWEEN DIFFERENT STOCKS CLOSING PRICE?
	5. WHAT WAS THE CORRELATION B/W DIFFERENT STOCKS DAILY RETURN?
	6. HOW MUCH VALUE DO WE PUT AT RISK BY INVESTING IN A PARTICULAR STOCK?
	7. HOW CAN BE ATTEMPT TO PREDICT FUTURE STOCK BEHAVIOR?
