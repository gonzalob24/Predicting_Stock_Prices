# STOCK MARKET ANALYSIS
------

###### Design Problem For Stock Market Prediction

My goal is to design a program that allows users to input stock ticker symbols and select from various tools to help predict the price of the stock. I will be using a few different machine learning algorithms to help with the analysis and to really take advantage in putting to work some of the techniques I have learned during Spring Semester 2020, after taking machine learning as an elective course. 

For this project I have studied several concepts related to the stock market and how I can use them as inputs to machine learning algorithms.

I will start with Linear Regression, Decision Trees and Support Vector Machines to try and capture the patterns present in the data to see how well these algorithms perform at predicting stock prices.

The program will output various metrics that measure the quality of the analysis as well as the accuracy of the results. The user will be able to visualize the results via tables and graphs. 

Support Vector Machines (SVM) are characterized by the control of the decision boundary, use of the kernel trick and other hyperparameters that will help fine tune the algorithm. To evaluate how well the SVM performs, compare its performance with other algorithms that will be implemented. 

Use data from yahoo finance or google finance no less than the last 3 years. Use 80% of the data for training and 20% for testing.



###### I will be using Pandas to get stock information and visualizeing it with seaborn. I will also look at different ways of anlyzing the risk of a stock, based on previous peformance. I will also be predicting future stock prices by using Monte Carlo Simulations. 


###### Along the way I will be ansering a few questions along the way. For Example:
	1. WHAT WAS THE CHANGE IN PRICE OF THE STOCK OVER TIME?
	2. WHAT WAS THE DAILY RETURN OF THE STOCK ON AVERAGE?
	3. WHAT WAS THE MOVING AVERAGE OF THE VAROIS STOCK?
	4. WHAT WAS THE CORRELATION BETWEEN DIFFERENT STOCKS CLOSING PRICE?
	5. WHAT WAS THE CORRELATION B/W DIFFERENT STOCKS DAILY RETURN?
	6. HOW MUCH VALUE DO WE PUT AT RISK BY INVESTING IN A PARTICULAR STOCK?
	7. HOW CAN BE ATTEMPT TO PREDICT FUTURE STOCK BEHAVIOR?
